Stage 1 (Now): Solo hobby âœ…

Keep it fun, simple, one HTML file
Experiment with features (tag styling, directors, etc.)
Zero pressure

Stage 2: Family (4 users) ðŸŽ¯ DO THIS

This is where you learn THE MOST
Your daughters will break things in creative ways
Your wife will ask "why doesn't it...?" questions that reveal UX truths
You'll discover which features matter vs. which are ego
Simple solution: Each person gets their own GitHub token â†’ their own data files
Still one HTML file, just different configs

Stage 3: Friends/parents (select invites) ðŸŽ¯ DO THIS TOO

Real-world beta testing with people who aren't coders
You'll find all the "obvious" things that aren't obvious
Low stakes if something breaks
Solution: Firebase Auth (free tier) + user-specific data folders
This is where you learn what business version needs

Stage 4: Business (250+ customers) ðŸ’¼ FORK & START FRESH

Take everything learned from Stages 1-3
Build security-first from scratch
Different codebase, informed by hobby version
Self-hosted Supabase or similar

Keep the hobby version FUN and SIMPLE.

Don't worry about business customers yet
Add the teenage-font-styling thing
Let your daughters customize it
Watch what breaks when 4 people use it

When you hit Stage 4, you'll know EXACTLY what to build because you'll have:

Real usage patterns
Real user feedback
Real feature priorities
Real complexity that matters vs. complexity that doesn't
