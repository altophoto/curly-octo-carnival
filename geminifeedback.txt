Thank you for pasting the code. This is perfect.
You were right, there is no main.js file. All your application's logic is inside the <script> tag at the very bottom of your index.html file.
I have found the exact source of your error and the reason it's happening.
🎯 The Problem: Invalid JSON in Your Repository
The error isn't that a file is missing (like a 404), but that the file it's loading is not valid JSON.
The error Error loading from GitHub: SyntaxError { } comes from this exact block of code in your script (around line 1700):
        async loadFromGitHub() {
            // ...
            try {
                // ...
                const response = await fetch(url, {
                    // ...
                });
                
                if (response.ok) {
                    const data = await response.json(); // <--- This is probably fine
                    this.fileSha = data.sha;
                    const content = atob(data.content);
                    this.films = JSON.parse(content); // <--- THIS is the line that fails
                    // ...
                } 
                // ...
            } catch (error) {
                // This line logs the exact error you are seeing
                console.error('Error loading from GitHub:', error); 
                // ...
            } 
            // ...
        },

Here is what's happening:
 * Your app successfully fetches data from the GitHub API.
 * The API sends back a JSON response that includes your file's content, encoded in a format called base64.
 * The line const content = atob(data.content); decodes this content back into plain text.
 * The line this.films = JSON.parse(content); then tries to parse that text as JSON.
 * This JSON.parse() is failing with a SyntaxError because the content of your films.json file in the repository is either completely empty or contains malformed JSON.
💡 How to Fix It
You need to ensure the films.json file in your repository contains valid JSON.
 * Go to your GitHub repository:
   https://github.com/altophoto/curly-octo-carnival
 * Click on the films.json file.
 * Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon.
 * If the file is empty: You must add valid JSON. For an empty list, this would be:
   []

 * If the file has content: Copy all of it and paste it into a validator like JSONLint to find the error. Common errors are:
   * A trailing comma after the last item in a list or object.
   * Using single quotes (') instead of double quotes (").
   * Missing brackets ([]) or braces ({}).
 * Once you have fixed the content, save the file by clicking "Commit changes...".
You must also do this for tags.json and directors.json. Your app also loads these files, and if they are also empty, they will cause the same type of error. Make sure they also contain at least [].
⚠️ A Note on Glaring Errors: Security
You asked for other glaring errors, and there is one major one you should be aware of.
Your code stores your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) in localStorage.
        loadToken() {
            const saved = localStorage.getItem('githubToken');
            // ...
        },
        saveToken() {
            // ...
            localStorage.setItem('githubToken', this.githubToken);
            // ...
        },

This is a significant security risk. localStorage is not secure. Any browser extension or third-party script you might add to this page in the future could potentially access it and steal your token. Since that token has repo permissions, a malicious script could delete all your repositories.
For a small personal project like this, it's a shortcut that works, but I must advise you to never do this for an application that other people will use. The token you are using should be treated as a password.
